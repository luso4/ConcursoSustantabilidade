This is a website that is being developed by me to the university Portucalense Infante D.Henrique.
This website has created with the porpuse of creating a fun and interactive game with the student of the university in order to increase the acts of sustainability that they practice.

In order to do that a website will be created that will allow the user to create an account, after that the webpage will display the leaderboard with the 3 first place and their score.
Under that information it will appear the name and score of the user.

In order to gain point the website will a function to activate the user camara. With this the user must read a qr code after doing a act of sustainability and it will award points to the user.
In order to not allow a user to repeat the reading of the qr code a timer will be implementd not allowing the user to repeatly read the same qr code and gain points.

A webpage with the points will also be avaliable to the user to know what points it will be awarded.
